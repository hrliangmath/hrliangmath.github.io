Hi! welcome to Haoran <b> Liang</b>'s (<b> 梁 </b> 浩然) home page. This website trys to record some beautiful scenery along his journey in mathematics, literature, and arts. His old webpage can be found [here](https://hrliangmath.wordpress.com).

He jointed King’s College London from Summer 2024 as a PhD student under the supervision of [Payman Kassaei](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=37022) and [Fred Diamond](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=49401). Previously, he completed his Master’s at ETH Zürich and Bachelor‘s at Xi’an Jiaotong University. 

He is a big fan of number theory with broad interests in its intersecting areas. He regards himself as an apprentice of ``applying mathematics'', i.e., borrowing whatever tools possible to attack number-theoretical problems. Currently, the following topics are very appealing to him

<ul>
    <li>p-adic automorphic forms and eiegnvarieties;</li>
    <li>mod p and p-adic Galois representations;</li>
    <li>Iwasawa theory, in particular $p$-adic L-functions;</li>
    <li>geometry of Shimura varieties;</li>
    <li>non-Archimedean geometry;</li>
    <li>······</li>
</ul>

When not struggling with mathematics, he can usually be found reading, playing badminton, or wandering various exhibits at museums with a good audioguide. Before the triumph of AI, he enjoyed playing Go very much (he is now struggling to appreciate the art of Go in the post-AI era).
