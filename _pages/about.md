Hi! welcome to Haoran <b> Liang</b>'s (<b> 梁 </b> 浩然) home page. 

This website aims to document some of the beautiful scenery along his journey through mathematics, literature, and art. His old webpage can be found [here](https://hrliangmath.wordpress.com).

He jointed King’s College London in Summer 2024 as a PhD student under the supervision of [Payman Kassaei](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=37022) and [Fred Diamond](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=49401). He is also fortunate to be aligned with the LSGNT program. Previously, he completed his Master’s at ETH Zürich and Bachelor‘s at Xi’an Jiaotong University. 

He is a big fan of number theory with broad interests in its intersecting areas. He considers himself as an apprentice in the art of ``applying mathematics'' -- that is, borrowing any tools available to tackle number-theoretical problems. Currently, he is particularly drawn to the following topics

<ul>
    <li> <i>p</i>-adic automorphic forms and eiegnvarieties;</li>
    <li>mod <i>p</i> and <i>p</i>-adic Galois representations;</li>
    <li>Iwasawa theory, especially <i> p</i>-adic <i>L</i>-functions;</li>
    <li>geometry of Shimura varieties;</li>
    <li>non-Archimedean geometry;</li>
    <li>······</li>
</ul>

When not struggling with mathematics, he can usually be found reading, playing badminton, or exploring museum exhibits (ideally with a good audioguide). Before the rise of AI, he greatly enjoyed playing Go; nowadays, he is learning to appreciate its artistry in the post-AI era.
